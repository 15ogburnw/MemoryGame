# Memory Game
## Springboard Unit 4 - DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates a simple memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players are shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal the color underneath. The player can choose how many colors to play with, 
and the colors are randomly generated in pairs. If the player does not choose a number, the game will default to 10 colors.

After clicking on two cards, the game checks to see whether their colors match. If they do, they will remain facing up. If not, the cards flip back down.

The goal of the game is to match up all the color pairs.
